Battle Rocks - Client And Server



Every physics object is handled by the client and the server
calculations are identical, result SHOULD BE identical, if they are not ?????? Have a syncing system in place that checks small amounts of them over time as to not affect performance

Every physics object is handled by client and server
every time a player touches or interacts with another physics object, it is marked, everything the marked obj impacts is marked too
every server tick, all marked objects are synced with server across all clients
Every server tick, all player movements and actions are synced
