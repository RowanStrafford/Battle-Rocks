Game scene (needs name)
God object inherits from monobehaviour 
It takes all the game's parameters and creates the map, the initial spawn points all through a seed? Oooooh :]
Seed contains map info + settings + all RNG (player cannot choose or see seed in challenge mode)

Handler (if necessary) is statics script that takes all the info anything can ever need:
Reference to God object
Reference to array list of physics objects
Reference to player
Etc
Only used to get this info, never change it
Is attached to God object?
(Probably not static)

Physics object manager is script 
That handles the rendering and ticking of every physics object in the scene as well as ordering etc
Is attached to God object and is ticked that way
