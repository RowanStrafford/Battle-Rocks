Game scene (needs name: Play?)

God script inherits from monobehaviour
	Each "Play Scene" takes into account: map size, shape, coords, rock spawning, diff... and stores that in a unique seed
	Reusing this seed recreates an identical game
	Player cannot choose or see seed in challenge mode?

Handler script is attached to god object
	It takes all the info anything can ever need:
		Reference to God object; Reference to array list of physics objects, Reference to player, Etc...
	Only used to get this info, never change it
	(Probably not static)

Physics object manager is script attached to god object 
	Handles the rendering and ticking of every physics object in the scene as well as ordering etc

Particle manager is script attached to god object
	Handles the rendering and ticking of every particle object
	Changing settings can change volume of particles

Do any of these scipts other than god script and perhaps one for setting certain variables need to be added as components?
